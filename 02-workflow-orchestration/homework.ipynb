    "### Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal will be to construct an ETL pipeline that loads the data, performs some transformations, and writes the data to a database (and Google Cloud!).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a new pipeline, call it `green_taxi_etl`\n",
    "- Add a data loader block and use Pandas to read data for the final quarter of 2020 (months `10`, `11`, `12`).\n",
    "  - You can use the same datatypes and date parsing methods shown in the course.\n",
    "  - `BONUS`: load the final three months using a for loop and `pd.concat`\n",
    "- Add a transformer block and perform the following:\n",
    "  - Remove rows where the passenger count is equal to 0 _and_ the trip distance is equal to zero.\n",
    "  - Create a new column `lpep_pickup_date` by converting `lpep_pickup_datetime` to a date.\n",
    "  - Rename columns in Camel Case to Snake Case, e.g. `VendorID` to `vendor_id`.\n",
    "  - Add three assertions:\n",
    "    - `vendor_id` is one of the existing values in the column (currently)\n",
    "    - `passenger_count` is greater than 0\n",
    "    - `trip_distance` is greater than 0\n",
    "- Using a Postgres data exporter (SQL or Python), write the dataset to a table called `green_taxi` in a schema `mage`. Replace the table if it already exists.\n",
    "- Write your data as Parquet files to a bucket in GCP, partioned by `lpep_pickup_date`. Use the `pyarrow` library!\n",
    "- Schedule your pipeline to run daily at 5AM UTC.\n",

    "### Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 1. Data Loading\n",
    "\n",

    "* 544,898 rows x 18 columns\n",
    "* 544,898 rows x 20 columns\n",
    "* 133,744 rows x 20 columns\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 2. Data Transformation\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon filtering the dataset where the passenger count is greater than 0 _and_ the trip distance is greater than zero, how many rows are left?\n",
    "\n",
    "* 544,897 rows\n",
    "* 266,855 rows\n",
    "* **139,370 rows**\n",
    "* 266,856 rows\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 3. Data Transformation\n",
    "\n",
    "Which of the following creates a new column `lpep_pickup_date` by converting `lpep_pickup_datetime` to a date?\n",
    "\n",
    "* `data = data['lpep_pickup_datetime'].date`\n",
    "* `data('lpep_pickup_date') = data['lpep_pickup_datetime'].date`\n",
    "* **`data['lpep_pickup_date'] = data['lpep_pickup_datetime'].dt.date`**\n",
    "* `data['lpep_pickup_date'] = data['lpep_pickup_datetime'].dt().date()`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 4. Data Transformation\n",
    "\n",
    "What are the existing values of `VendorID` in the dataset?\n",
    "\n",
    "* 1, 2, or 3\n",
    "* **1 or 2**\n",
    "* 1, 2, 3, 4\n",
    "* 1\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 5. Data Transformation\n",
    "\n",
    "How many columns need to be renamed to snake case?\n",
    "\n",
    "* 3\n",
    "* 6\n",
    "* 2\n",
    "* **4**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 6. Data Exporting\n",
    "\n",
    "Once exported, how many partitions (folders) are present in Google Cloud?\n",
    "\n",
    "* **96**\n",
    "* 56\n",
    "* 67\n",
    "* 108\n",
